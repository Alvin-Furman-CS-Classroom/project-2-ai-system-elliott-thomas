# [Your System Title]

## Overview

Provide a concise system overview (200-300 words). Explain the unifying theme and how the modules combine into a coherent AI system.

## Team

- Member 1
- Member 2
- Member 3 (if applicable)

## Proposal

Link to the approved Project 1 proposal (or paste a short summary here).

## Module Plan

Your system must include 5-6 modules. Fill in the table below as you plan each module.

| Module | Topic(s) | Inputs | Outputs | Depends On | Checkpoint |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 6 (optional) |  |  |  |  |  |

## Repository Layout

```
your-repo/
├── src/                              # main system source code
├── unit_tests/                       # unit tests (parallel structure to src/)
├── integration_tests/                # integration tests (new folder for each module)
├── .claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md  # rubric-based agent review
├── AGENTS.md                         # instructions for your LLM agent
└── README.md                         # system overview and checkpoints
```

## Setup

List dependencies, setup steps, and any environment variables required to run the system.

## Running

Provide commands or scripts for running modules and demos.

## Testing

**Unit Tests** (`unit_tests/`): Mirror the structure of `src/`. Each module should have corresponding unit tests.

**Integration Tests** (`integration_tests/`): Create a new subfolder for each module beyond the first, demonstrating how modules work together.

Provide commands to run tests and describe any test data needed.

## Checkpoint Log

| Checkpoint | Date | Modules Included | Status | Evidence |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |

## Required Workflow (Agent-Guided)

Before each module:

1. Write a short module spec in this README (inputs, outputs, dependencies, tests).
2. Ask the agent to propose a plan in "Plan" mode.
3. Review and edit the plan. You must understand and approve the approach.
4. Implement the module in `src/`.
5. Unit test the module, placing tests in `unit_tests/` (parallel structure to `src/`).
6. For modules beyond the first, add integration tests in `integration_tests/` (new subfolder per module).
7. Run a rubric review using the code-review skill at `.claude/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`.

Keep `AGENTS.md` updated with your module plan, constraints, and links to APIs/data sources.

## References

List libraries, APIs, datasets, and other references used by the system.
